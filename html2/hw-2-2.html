  <p>Fallout Shelter is a management and construction simulation game where players act as the Overseer of a Vault, building and expanding the shelter to house survivors and manage resources like food, water, and power. The "storyline" is a continuous gameplay loop focused on keeping dwellers happy and safe by assigning them jobs, sending them on quests in the Wasteland, and defending the Vault from threats like raiders, fires, and mutant creatures, rather than a traditional linear plot with an ending.</p>
